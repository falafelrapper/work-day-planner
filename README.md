# Fullstack Development Challenge 3

## Welcome to the fifth Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

In this challenge we were supposed to rework a starter code so that it would show a daily work planner in which you could set notes for each time slot. Depending on the time, each time slot would show a color for a "past", "present", and "future" state, corresponding with grey, red, and green. To start, we should follow our user story on what we want to solve:

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should now have a planner that matches the tab colors with the current time, shows the current day at the top, and allows you to save notes to your localStorage so that when you refresh, it will stay saved.
